Building Applications
==================
This section documents how to configure and package **ManiVault-based applications** using the facilities provided by the core and its plugins.

The pages in this section focus on:
- Customizing application identity, branding, and start-page behavior
- Publishing projects for controlled, read-only distribution
- Exposing remote projects and tutorials on the application start page
- Customizing the splash screen using HTML assets

All topics are covered from an application designer’s perspective and describe workflows that can be performed through the UI, supported configuration files, or a combination of both.
