# Building ManiVault

Building **ManiVault** is straightforward. We provide dedicated tools that simplify the entire process, allowing you to swiftly create a turn-key build environment with all required dependencies, projects, and tooling preconfigured. You can even manage multiple build environments side by side without any hassle.

We strongly recommend using the {doc}`DEV Bundle <dev_bundle>` tool to set up your build environment. If you prefer to generate the build environment yourself, you will find {doc}`this section <manually>` helpful.
