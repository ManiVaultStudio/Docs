Action GUI building blocks
==================
**ManiVault Studio** provides a set of action GUI building blocks – modular UI components (built on Qt widgets) that plugin developers use to create interactive controls in their plugins
[1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10290921). These “actions” encapsulate common GUI elements (text fields, sliders, toggles, etc.) along with built-in behaviors for state management and inter-plugin communication. In this guide, we’ll cover what these action blocks are, their purpose in **ManiVault**, how to customize their behavior and appearance, and how to extend them for new functionality.
