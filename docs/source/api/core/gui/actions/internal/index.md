# Internal

This section documents action types that are part of the public API but are primarily intended for internal consumption by the core system and selected first-party plugins. They support application-specific behavior, UI integration, and internal workflows rather than serving as general-purpose extension points.

While these actions are accessible, they should be considered implementation-oriented and may change as internal requirements evolve.
