# Actions

The following pages describe the available action types and their associated APIs, focusing on their structure, configuration, and integration points within the system. These actions form the foundation for representing user interactions, commands, and state across the application and its plugins.

In addition to the documented public action categories, the system also exposes a set of actions that are primarily intended for internal use. These are described separately under the [internal actions](internal/index) section and are used extensively by the core system and selected first-party plugins.
