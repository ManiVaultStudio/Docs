# Core

This section contains the authoritative reference documentation for the core components of the system. It is intended for developers who need a detailed understanding of the available APIs, internal architecture, and extension points.

The documentation is organized by functional areas, including managers, utilities, GUI infrastructure, widgets, models, and other foundational modules. Each page focuses on concrete interfaces, responsibilities, and usage patterns rather than high-level concepts or tutorials.

Use this section when you need precise information about classes, functions, data structures, and their interactions, or when implementing integrations, plugins, or advanced customizations.
