# Scripts

**ManiVault** provides scripting capabilities to automate workflows and extend functionality. Currently, scripting is supported via **Python**, with the possibility of adding other languages (for example **R**) in the future. The models described below keep track of all available scripts and their organization, while the script manager interfaces with these models to manage and execute scripts.
