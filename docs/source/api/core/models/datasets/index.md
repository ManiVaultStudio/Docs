# Datasets

Datasets are stored in the {doc}`Data Manager <api/core/managers/abstract_data_manager>` and their lifetime is tracked by the model classes below.

```{note}
This API is **stable** and intended for use by **core developers**. Plugin developers typically do not need to interact with it directly, as it is fully wrapped by the {cpp:class}`data manager <mv::AbstractDataManager>`.
