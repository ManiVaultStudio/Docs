# Color Schemes

Color schemes alter the look-and-feel of **ManiVault Studio**. Color schemes can be added, removed and altered from the GUI. The classes below are used to store, present and filter color schemes.

```{note}
This API is **stable** and intended for use by **core developers**. Plugin developers typically do not need to interact with it directly, as it is fully wrapped by the {cpp:class}`theme manager <mv::AbstractThemeManager>`.
