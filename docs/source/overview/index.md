## Introduction

[ManiVault](https://www.manivault.studio/) is a flexible and extensible plugin-based visual analytics framework for high-dimensional data.

The system allows for creating custom visualization applications tailored to your specific field, data, and preferences. Applications are composed of several modular plugins, that can be combined to fit your needs. The plugins are fully self-encapsulated but can communicate through ManiVault's [core](https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio/core).





## Using the system
You can get started using the system with a selection of plug-ins right now by downloading the [**ManiVault Studio Installer**](https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio/Installer/releases).

## Developing with the system
### Requirements
* [**Qt 6.8.3**](https://www.qt.io/download)

### Usage
The easiest way to get started developing with ManiVault is to use the [**Development Bundle**](https://github.com/ManiVaultStudio/DevBundle).
Detailed instructions to get the system set up on your machine can be found there.
